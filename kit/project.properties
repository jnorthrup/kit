maven.jnlp.description.one-line=kit
#   	Yes 	If a reference to the application is going to appear in one row in a list or a table, this description will be used.
maven.jnlp.description.short=kit
#  	Yes 	The short description of the application. If a reference to the application is going to be displayed in a situation where there is room for a paragraph, this description is used. 	${pom.shortDescription}

maven.jnlp.permission=all
  #	Yes 	Possible values : all or j2ee. The specification specifies two trusted environments, the all-permissions environment and an environment that meets the security specifications of the J2EE Application Client environment. Both of these environments provide unrestricted access to the network and local disk. Thus, an application can intentionally or unintentionally harm the local system. An application must only be launched if it is trusted.

  # 	Yes 	Describes supported version of the JRE. 	1.4
#maven.jnlp.j2se.heapsize.initial 

# 	Yes 	Indicates the initial size of the Java heap. The modifiers m and k can be used for megabytes and kilobytes, respectively. For example, "128m" will be the same as specifying "134217728" (128*1024*1024). The modifiers are not case-sensitive. 	32m
maven.jnlp.j2se.heapsize.max  1500m

#maven.jnlp.cert.version=yes
  # 	Yes 	A version string to be appended to each dependency version when generating version.xml. (This is only useful if maven.jnlp.usejarversions is set to true).
#This comes in handy, when your code signing certificate expires and is renewed. Java Web Start requires that ALL jars be signed with the same certificate.
#When renewing a certificate you must change all of the version numbers of all jars, so that the JWS client will re-download the jars that haven't changed,
#but have only been re-signed by the new key. With this property, when you get a renewed key, all you have to do, is update the maven.jnlp.cert.version string
#to a new value, and the new version.xml will have all new version strings for ALL jars. 	false
